# My First Carousel

* **Objective** - To create a carousel which cycles through 3 images.
* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with how carousels are created in HTML.

## Part 1 - Clone the project
* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).

## Part 2 - Add new images to the carousel
* Remove the images located in the `img` directory.
* Replace the images with images that you would like to see on the page.
* Rename the references to the images in the `index.html`

## Part 3 - Integrate With previous assignment
* Using the code-base that you have just created, refer to one of the old labs.
* Modify either your [my-first-bootstrap-resume](https://github.com/CodeDifferently/my-first-bootstrap-resume) or your [my-first-multipage-project](https://github.com/CodeDifferently/my-multipage-project) by adding a carousel to the project.
